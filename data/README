This folder is mounted as a shared folder within the VMs and ansible expects to
find vagrant.pub, the public key corressponding to the private key vagrant will
use to ssh into the guest VMs, in this directory.  Rather than check the keys
into source control, we will create them in ../../keys and link to the public
key here.

If vagrant.pub does not exist here, run:

  ln -s ../../keys/vagrant.pub ./vagrant.pub

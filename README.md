# networking
============

This project automates building the demo image for the networking1 and
networking2 classes.

Prerequisites
=============
This project assumes you have the vagrantbox project installed.  The setup
script for the vagrantbox project creates the ssh keypair for the vagrant
user and includes packer configs to build any necessary base boxes.  If you
don't create the base boxes ahead of time, the setup script in this project
will create just the base boxes it needs.

Creating the VMs
================
Creating the VMs is as simple as running "vagrant up" and having patience.

Enjoy!
